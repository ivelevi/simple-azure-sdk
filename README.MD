# Simple use of Azure SDK
# Azure Resource Management Script
## Overview
This Python script automates the creation and management of Azure resources. It performs the following tasks:

Creates an Azure resource group.
Deploys a Virtual Machine (VM) with specified configurations.
Sets up an Azure SQL Database.
Configures a Storage Account.
Includes functions for VM management: start, stop, and delete.

Requirements
Python 3.x: The script is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.
Azure SDK for Python: Install the required Azure SDK packages.
Azure CLI: Ensure Azure CLI is installed and authenticated.
Azure Credentials: Configure your Azure credentials using DefaultAzureCredential.

## Installation

Install the necessary Azure SDK packages using pip:

```sh
pip install azure-mgmt-resource azure-mgmt-compute azure-mgmt-sql azure-mgmt-storage azure-identity
```
Set Up Azure Credentials:

Ensure you have logged in to Azure using Azure CLI:

```sh
az login
```
Alternatively, configure your environment to use a service principal or managed identity.

## Configuration
Update Script Parameters:

Modify the script to set desired parameters such as:

Resource group name
VM size and configuration
SQL Database settings
Storage account configuration
Script Usage
Save the Script:

Save the provided Python script to a file, e.g., azure_setup.py.

Run the Script:

Execute the script using Python:

```sh
python azure_setup.py
```

## Best Practices
Parameterization: For flexibility, use environment variables or configuration files to set parameters.
Security: Use Azure Key Vault or environment variables for managing sensitive information.
Testing: Test the script in a staging environment before using it in production.


## Troubleshooting
Resource Already Exists: Check if resources already exist and adjust the script accordingly.
Permission Issues: Ensure your Azure credentials have sufficient permissions for resource creation.
API Limits: Be aware of Azure API rate limits and quotas.
